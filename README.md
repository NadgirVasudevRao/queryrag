# RAG Chatbot Streamlit App

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit, FAISS, and Hugging Face models. This project allows you to input a website URL or upload a document (PDF, TXT, DOCX), index its content, and ask natural language questions with quick, accurate answers.

## üöÄ Features

- **Website & File Inputs**: Paste any public URL or upload a PDF/TXT/DOCX file.
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time green progress bar and status messages during processing.
- **Text Extraction**: HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup; PDF, DOCX, and TXT support.
- **Chunking & Embedding**: Splits text into chunks and creates embeddings with SentenceTransformer.
- **Vector Search**: Builds a FAISS index for fast similarity search.
- **LLM Inference**: Uses free Hugging Face models (e.g., Falcon, T5) to generate answers.
- **Prompt Refinement**: Ensures the model only outputs concise answers without echoing headers.
- **Context Display**: Collapsible context snippets so you can see where answers come from.
- **Index Persistence**: Saves and reloads FAISS index and chunks to disk for instant startup.
- **Deployment Ready**: Easily deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
